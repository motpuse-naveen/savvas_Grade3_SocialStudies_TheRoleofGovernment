                    <p>This text set includes four informational texts and a video. All deal with an aspect of how the American government works.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold"><i>Why Do We Have a Government?</i></span> is the anchor text for this set. Depending on the needs of your class, you may choose to assign <span class="bold"><i>Why Do We Have a Government?</i></span> for independent reading, or you may choose to read it aloud with the class. Beginning with the anchor text will ground students in concepts and academic vocabulary that are key to discussing the Big Question. As students read the other texts in the set, they will compare their new understandings, as well as the structure and features of the text, with the anchor text.</p>
                    <p>After students read the anchor text, you may choose to assign specific texts or encourage students to choose the texts that appeal to them the most. Use the table below to see where specific text structures and text features appear across the texts in this set.</p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>What role does the government play in improving our lives?</i>
                        Say: <span class="blue_scripting">Why do you think we have a government? In what ways could the government help people or improve their lives?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span
                                class="bold">government, responsibility,</i></span> and <span class="bold"><i>service.</span></i>
                                Discuss the meaning of each word with the class.
                        Say: <span class="blue_scripting"> The <span class="bold">government</span> includes people who make laws and people who lead a city, town, or country. Who are some people in the <span class="bold">government</span>? What is one of your <span class="bold">responsibilities</span> at school? A <span class="bold">service</span> is a way of giving someone help. The government gives services, such as helping kids go to school. What is another example of a service?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>Why Do We Have a Government?</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">What makes a country a <span class="bold">democracy</span>? Who can vote in a democracy? A <span class="bold">legislature</span> can make laws. What kinds of laws do you think our state’s legislature should pass?</p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Word Webs</span></h3>
                    <p>Tell students that one way to learn new words is to think about how a new word is connected to other words they already know. Display a word web graphic organizer with <span class="bold">government</span> in the center. Have students copy their own word webs in their notebooks. Ask them to add to the web with words they already know as well as new vocabulary words for <i>Why Do We Have a Government?</i> A completed word web might look like this:</p>
                    <p>[insert word web with <i>government</i> in the center and these words branching around it:

What do you think the text is describing? </span> (government) Read screens 2 and 3 (Printable Text p. x). Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What is one responsibility of the government?</span>
                            (keeping people safe) Ask students to look for more details and examples about government responsibilities as they read.
                        </p>    

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Descriptive Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about descriptive structure and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “tells about what something is or what it is like,” “gives details or examples”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Text Features</span> Explain that headings help people understand what they read by introducing the topic of a section. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">This text has different sections, or parts, with headings. What is the first heading you see?</span> (What Is a Government?) <span class="blue_scripting">What do you think that section will be about? </span> Have students preview other headings and predict what they will read about in each section.</p>

                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column, write “Headings.” Work with the class to fill in the column with examples of how headings help readers understand the text. For example: “tell the reader what a section is about”</p>

                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>What role does the government play in improving our lives?</i>
                        Say: <span class="blue_scripting">The US Congress makes up the legislative branch in our government. Congress meets at the Capitol. How do you think learning about the US Capitol will help you understand how parts of the government work together?</span></p>

Who do you think is part of the legislative branch? A <span class="bold">bill</span> is an idea for a law. How do you think a bill could become a law?</span></p>

                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>Capitol Visitor Center</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">Does our state have a large <span class="bold">population</span>? Which state do you think has the biggest <span class="bold">population</span> in the country?</span> </p>

Help students practice with a word web about the legislative branch of the government.

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Big Question</span></h3>
                    <p>Remind students of the Big Question: <i>What role does the government play in improving our lives?</i> Explain that the US Constitution sets out the main system of laws in the country. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">The Constitution helps explain how the government works in the United States. Why do you think it’s important to have a constitution? How does the Constitution improve people’s lives?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Preview Vocabulary</span></h3>
                    <p>Have students find and read sentences in the text that have the words <i><span class="bold">responsibility</span></i> and <i><span class="bold">Constitution</span>.</i> Discuss the meaning of each word with the class. Say: <span class="blue_scripting">The US government has different parts. What are some of the <span class="bold">responsibilities</span> of each part of the government? The <span class="bold">Constitution</span> is a piece of writing that explains how the government works in the United States. Why is having a constitution important?</span></p>

                    <h3 class="normaltext"><span class="bold uppercase">Oral Vocabulary</h3>
                    <p>Some of the vocabulary in <i>How the Constitution Works</i> includes words that might be new or challenging. During class discussions, use these new terms repeatedly to help students become familiar with them. For example: <span class="blue_scripting">The purpose of <span class="bold">checks</span> and <span class="bold">balances</span> was to make sure no part of the government had too much power. What is one way a branch of the government can check, or limit, another branch?</span> </p>

                    <p>Tell students that one way to learn new words is to think about how a new word is connected to other words they already know. Display a word web graphic organizer. Help students practice with a word web about the Constitution. When they read <span class="bold">How the Constitution Works,</span> encourage them to add words to their web that relate to this word. A completed word web might look like this:</p>
                    <p>[insert word web with <i>constitution</i> in the center, and these words around the web:]
                        checks		balances		government	amendment</p>

                    <p>Display a T-chart graphic organizer. At the top of the left column, write “Chronological Structure.” Work with the class to fill in the column with what they know about chronological structure and how it helps them understand the writer’s ideas. For example: “explains what happened in order”</p>

Ask: <span class="blue_scripting">What was the first plan for the government?</span> (The Articles of Confederation)</p>
                    <p>Return to the T-chart. At the top of the right column, write “Headings.” Work with the class to fill in the column with examples of how headings help readers understand the text. For example: “tell the topic or main idea of a section”</p>

                    <p>Now that the class has read some or all of the texts in this set, it is time to pull together all the information they have learned from their reading in order to explore and share their evolving understanding of the Big Question.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Expanding Word Webs</span> Have students review the word webs they have created for the texts they have read. Put students in pairs or small groups and have them make a larger word web on a large sheet of paper. Have them write <i>government</i> in the center and choose words to add around the web. Encourage students to explain why they added the words they did.</p>


                    <h2 id="scrollTop_s7_3">Discuss the Text Set's Big Question</h2>
                    <p>Guide a class discussion around the Big Question: <i>What role does the government play in improving our lives?</i> Encourage students to bring in knowledge they have learned from all the texts they have read in the text set, using as many of the words from their word webs as they can.</p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">

                        <li>What did you learn about how the government can help people? What else would you like to learn about the government?</li>
                        <li>What responsibilities do different parts of the government have? How do they play different roles in people’s lives?</li>

                    <p>Help students brainstorm important issues that affect your community and how the government can help. Then, choose a government official who represents your area. Students can choose an issue that you brainstormed and write a letter to the official about it. Review formal letter writing format before students begin writing. Remind them to review what they wrote in Write About the Big Question for each text to help them think about what they have learned about government. When students have finished writing, gather the letters and send them to the official.</p>
                    <p>Some students may benefit from working with a partner. Students may use the <span class="bold"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="activitySupport" popupref="popup-ar-31">Project Template</a></span> to help them organize and clarify their thinking as they plan their letters.

                    <p>Provide time for students to practice sharing their culminating project. If they are working with a partner, remind them to work collaboratively and follow agreed upon rules, norms, and protocols.</p>
                    <p>Use the bulleted points below to model good speaking and listening skills.</p>

                        students feel empowered to participate in powerful classroom conversation. You may have noticed
                        that
                        your students who are naturally extroverted often participate freely in a whole-class
                        discussion,
                        while those who are more introverted or, perhaps, who come from cultures that respect different
                        classroom norms, may need encouragement to share. You can use sentence prompts like these to
                        invite
                        all students into the conversation:</p>
                    <p>“That’s so interesting … please tell me more!”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone explain that in a different way?”</p>
                    <p>“What are some examples of that?”</p>
                    <p>“Can someone add on to that idea?”</p>
                    <p>Sharing and discussing ideas will often involve agreeing and/or disagreeing with what others say.
                        As
                        students listen carefully and respond thoughtfully to their classmates’ ideas, encourage them to
                        express themselves in respectful and constructive ways. You may wish to post these sentence
                        starters
                        prominently, so students can refer to them often:</p>
                    <p>“I agree, and I also think <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I mostly agree, but <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span class="solidl"
                            aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I like what you just said because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
                    <p>“I respectfully disagree because <span class="sr-only">fill in the blank line</span><span
                            class="solidl" aria-hidden="true">__________</span> <span aria-hidden="true">.”</span></p>
